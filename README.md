The source of the microeconomic data used in this code is the World Bank Microdata Library. It is part of a Living Standards Measurement Study in Malawi from 2010 - 2016, the [Integrated Household Panel Survey 2010-2013-2016, 2013 EAs](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2939). The World Bank documentation [Malawi Drought 2015 - 2016: Post-Disaster Needs Assessment](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/640011479881661626/Malawi-drought-2015-2016-post-disaster-needs-assessment-PDNA) was used to evaluate and incorporate district need on a standardized scale to determine a relationship between vulnerability, migration and the climate shock of the drought.
